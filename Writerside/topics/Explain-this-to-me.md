# Explain this to me

When you use the eval function, the user using your program can execute whatever script they want. So theoretically,  let's say you have a website. On the front-end you use JavaScript. On the back-end you use Python. There is a form on the website that lets you solve equations using "eval()". The backend returns the answer, but on the backend, there is data being stored. So you could type in, "return passwords", and it would return an array of passwords the website has.
